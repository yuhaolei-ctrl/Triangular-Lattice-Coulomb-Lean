"""Keep the definitions of `Challenge.lean` and `TriangularLattice/Statement.lean` identical.

Comparator requires every definition reached from a compared statement to be identical in the
Challenge and Solution environments. The Solution obtains these definitions from
`TriangularLattice.Statement`, which is generated from `Challenge.lean` by dropping the theorems
(the statements with deliberate holes) and replacing the module documentation.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/sync-statement.py          # rewrite TriangularLattice/Statement.lean
  python3 scripts/sync-statement.py --check  # fail if it is out of date
